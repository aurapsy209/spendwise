# SpendWise — Expense Tracker SaaS

## Project Overview
A SaaS expense tracking web app built with React + TypeScript + Vite. Uses Supabase for auth and cloud database.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 4
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (indigo/purple theme)
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **State**: useReducer + React Context
- **Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) — replaces localStorage
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth (email/password)

## Architecture & State Flow

All app state lives in `useExpenses.ts` (useReducer). `useAppContext.ts` wraps it in a React Context so any component can read state and call actions without prop-drilling.

**Auth flow:** `useAuth.ts` manages the Supabase session. `App.tsx` checks auth first — unauthenticated users see `AuthPage`. Once authenticated, `AppWithData` mounts with `userId` and passes it to `useExpenses(userId)`.

**Data flow:**
1. User action → component calls action from `useAppContext` (e.g. `addExpense`)
2. `useExpenses` dispatches to `appReducer` → optimistic UI update immediately
3. Supabase call happens async in the background; on error, the optimistic update is rolled back
4. On initial load, data is fetched from Supabase and loaded via `IMPORT_DATA` dispatch
5. Derived data (summaries, budget statuses) is computed via `useMemo` in `useExpenses` and exposed through context

**Supabase DB columns** use snake_case; app types use camelCase. Mapping happens in `src/lib/supabase.ts` via `toExpense`, `toDbExpense`, `toBudget`, `toDbBudget`.

**Key type constraints:**
- `Expense.date` is always `YYYY-MM-DD` string (no time component)
- `selectedMonth` is always `YYYY-MM` string
- `Budget.period` is always `'monthly'` (yearly/weekly not yet supported)
- `CategoryId` is a fixed union — adding a category requires updating both `types/index.ts` and `utils/categories.ts`

**Adding a new view:** add the view name to `ActiveView` in `types/index.ts`, add a nav item in `Sidebar.tsx`, and add a render case in `App.tsx`.

## Features
- Dashboard with stat cards, area chart, pie chart, 6-month bar chart
- Transactions stat card navigates to Expenses page filtered to current month
- Budget stat card navigates to Budget page
- Add/edit/delete expenses with category, amount, date, notes
- 10 built-in categories (Food, Transport, Bills, Entertainment, etc.)
- Custom categories saved per user in Supabase (`user_categories` table), selectable in future expenses
- Budget setting per category with visual progress bars
- Sort expenses by date (newest/oldest) or amount (highest/lowest)
- Custom date range filter (start date / end date) on Expenses page
- Search and category filter on Expenses page
- Reports with 3/6/12 month breakdowns — custom categories shown as own slices
- CSV, JSON backup, and PDF export (browser print-to-PDF, no dependencies)
- Multi-currency support — 20 currencies, per-expense exchange rate, home currency selector in sidebar
- Recurring expenses — daily/weekly/monthly/yearly schedules, auto-generates missed expenses on load, pause/resume/delete
- Vercel Analytics integration
- Mobile-first responsive design with bottom nav on mobile
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility (focus trapping, aria labels, skip-link)
- Supabase cloud sync — data persists across devices
- User authentication (email/password via Supabase Auth)
- PWA — installable on Android and iPhone via browser "Add to Home Screen"

## Supabase Tables
| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `expenses` | All expense records, RLS per user |
| `budgets` | Per-category monthly budgets, RLS per user |
| `user_categories` | Custom category names per user, RLS per user |
| `user_settings` | Per-user settings (home_currency), RLS per user |
| `recurring_expenses` | Recurring expense templates, auto-generates expenses on load, RLS per user |

## Planned Improvements
- [ ] Dark mode toggle
- [ ] Notifications/reminders for budget thresholds
- [x] User authentication (Supabase Auth)
- [x] Cloud sync for multi-device support
- [x] Custom categories per user
- [x] PWA (installable on mobile)
- [x] Multi-currency support (20 currencies, exchange rate per expense, home currency setting)
- [x] Recurring expenses (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly, auto-generates on load)
- [x] PDF export (browser print-to-PDF, styled HTML report)
- [x] Vercel Analytics

## Multi-Currency Notes
- `exchangeRate` = units of home currency per 1 unit of expense currency
- All totals/summaries use `amount * (exchangeRate ?? 1)` to convert to home currency
- Static rates in `currencies.ts` (pivot via USD); users can override per-expense
- Home currency stored in `user_settings` table, loaded on mount

## Recurring Expenses Notes
- Auto-generation runs once on app load via `useEffect` in `useExpenses.ts`
- Loop cap of 365 iterations per recurring rule to prevent infinite loops
- New recurring expenses added mid-session won't generate until next page refresh
- `advanceDueDate()` handles daily/weekly/monthly/yearly advancement correctly
